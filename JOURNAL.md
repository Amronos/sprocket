I reworked the template these 2 days to create a temporary UI that feels more like an AI chatting app.<br>
Right now, there is just a default message sent as a response to the user's messages without any LLM functionality in it.

## 15th August 2025

I set up a [template from Convex](https://github.com/get-convex/templates/tree/main/template-nextjs-shadcn) today, the template came with a very basic chat app in which multiple users can talk to each other.<br>
I then added Auth to the app through WorkOS.<br>
The project will use Convex, React, Next.js, Tailwind, shadcn/ui, and WorkOS for now.
