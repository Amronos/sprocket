## 5th to 6th September 2025

There is a sidebar now, through which you can switch between conversations/projects and create new ones.<br>
I also added automatic title generation for the conversations.

## 2nd to 4th September 2025

I implemented actual AI functionality into the app, the user can now chat with an AI like any other AI chat app.<br>
Convex's agent component was very useful in this.<br>
Complex responses currently look very bad, you can't have more than one conversation, and can't switch between AI models.
The next step is to implement all of these then proceed with the actual features of the app.

## 30th to 31st August 2025

I reworked the template these 2 days to create a temporary UI that feels more like an AI chatting app.<br>
Right now, there is just a default message sent as a response to the user's messages without any LLM functionality in it.

## 15th August 2025

I set up a [template from Convex](https://github.com/get-convex/templates/tree/main/template-nextjs-shadcn) today, the template came with a very basic chat app in which multiple users can talk to each other.<br>
I then added Auth to the app through WorkOS.<br>
The project will use Convex, React, Next.js, Tailwind, shadcn/ui, and WorkOS for now.
